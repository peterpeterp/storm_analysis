Tropical storm detection
========================

This module gives a framework for the implementation of storm tracking
algorithms. Currently two storm tracking algorithms are implemented.
Thresholds of the algorithms can easily be adapted and testing new
tracking algorithms is straight forward within this framework.

Data preprocessing
------------------

Depending on the detection algorithm, climate variable fields have to be
provided in the form of dimarrayâ€™s.

.. code:: python

   import dimarray as da
   U850=da.read_nc(file_name_of_U)['var33']
   V850=da.read_nc(file_name_of_V)['var34']
